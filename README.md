# Dev Cafe- A Blog Website for Tech Enthusiast

## Description
Dev Cafe is a React-based blog site where visitors can read articles on various development technologies. Users can bookmark blogs for later reading and mark them as read. Once a blog is marked as read, it is automatically removed from the bookmarks section. The site fetches all data from a custom API named `blog.json`.

## Key Features
1. **Read Blogs**: Visitors can access a variety of development tech blogs.
2. **Bookmark Blogs**: Users can bookmark blogs they want to revisit later.
3. **Mark as Read**: Users can mark a blog as read, which removes it from their bookmarks.
4. **Custom API**: All blog data is fetched from a custom API (`blog.json`), ensuring seamless updates.
5. **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## ES6 Features Used
- **Arrow Functions**: Used for concise function declarations and callbacks.
- **Promises**: Implemented for handling asynchronous data fetching from the API.
- **Template Literals**: Used for dynamic string interpolation in rendering components.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Simplified the extraction of properties from objects.
